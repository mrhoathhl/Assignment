Advantages

	* Fast coding, allowing for quick demo deployment.

Disadvantages

	* The code lacks proper systematic organization.

	* Overuse of unnecessary Resources.Load calls.

	* Usage of FindObjectOfType — a cause for long game startup times when the scene has many elements to initialize.

	* Code management and separation of gameplay components (items, bonus items, board, etc.) are not well-defined, causing tight coupling that makes maintenance and future expansion difficult.

	* All game assets, configurations, and settings should be converted into ScriptableObjects for easier management and scalability.

	* The LevelManager file includes many unnecessary virtual Setup methods.

	* Using Update for item selection handling is inefficient and resource-intensive.

	* BoardController violates the Single Responsibility Principle — it handles too many responsibilities in one file.

	* ShiftDownItemsCoroutine uses a fixed delay time, which can cause bugs or player discomfort if animations finish too early or too late.

	* Several functions are duplicated.

	* Coroutines are heavily used and sometimes overlap excessively.

Optimization Suggestions:

	* Apply appropriate design patterns, such as the Composite Design Pattern, to better separate concerns using a clear Controller - Model - ViewModel structure. Each layer should 	have its own data and interact strictly through the model to avoid tangled or cross-dependent code.

	* Since the game mainly follows a single action followed by a specific scripted flow, consider implementing the Command Design Pattern or a State Machine to manage that flow. This would help structure processes like: hint → check match → match animation (or not) → match effects → claim, etc. It will significantly improve debugging, maintenance, and scalability.

	* Restructure the code to minimize the use of Unity's MonoBehaviour lifecycle methods (Update, Start, Awake, etc.) where possible.

	* Convert all game assets, configurations, and settings into ScriptableObjects to simplify management and expansion.

	* Separate processing logic into individual modules for better organization and maintainability.

	* Manage the number of active coroutines by either tracking them explicitly or using a clear IsBusy flag or a processing queue to avoid overlap and race conditions.

	* Add custom logging at key gameplay stages such as: swap, match, collapse, refill, shuffle, etc., to aid debugging and tracking game state transitions.
